=================

The `TThumbnailPreview` control is a special list view for displaying the thumbnails of pages generated by a [TPrintPreview](TPrintPreview.md) control.

Additionally, a user can use this control to reorder pages or perform some actions on the selected pages (e.g. delete, print, move, and so on).
